# AI Training Data Compliance – Accessible Reporting Flow

A low-cognitive-load, WCAG-aligned demo for reporting potential issues in AI training data (licensing, sensitivity, provenance).

This project demonstrates how **compliance-critical workflows** can be designed to reduce user anxiety, prevent errors, and support accessibility — even when built quickly with common tools.

## 🧠 Problem This Demo Solves

Teams working with AI training data often face moments where someone thinks:

> “This data *might* be risky… but I’m not sure, and I don’t want to block deployment by mistake.”

These are **high-stakes but infrequent decisions**, usually made under time pressure. Traditional compliance tools often:
- overload users with terminology
- punish uncertainty
- require unnecessary detail up front

This demo intentionally designs *against* that.

## 🎯 Design Goals

- **Reduce cognitive load** during high-risk decisions
- **Encourage reporting without fear**
- **Support accessibility by default**
- **Fit real compliance & ops workflows**
- **Scale to complex systems without exposing complexity**

Clarity > speed  
Confidence > completeness  
Safety > blame

## 🧩 What This Demo Includes

### 1. Two-Screen Reporting Flow

**Screen 1 – Identify the Issue**
- Single decision per screen
- Plain-language options (recognition over recall)
- Large touch targets
- No required typing

**Screen 2 – Confirm & Submit**
- Clear summary of the selected issue
- Optional context field (explicitly optional)
- Reassurance that reporting does *not* automatically block deployment

### 2. Accessibility-First Design (WCAG 2.1 AA+)

Built-in support for:
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen readers (ARIA roles, live regions)
- High contrast mode
- Reduced motion (respects OS preferences)
- Adjustable text sizes
- Large touch targets (44px+)

Accessibility is treated as a **product requirement**, not a feature.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure & Reassurance

- No jargon
- No irreversible actions
- Calm validation language
- Clear “you can change this later” messaging
- Edit-after-submit support

This is intentional compliance UX — not fo
