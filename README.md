# AI Training Data Compliance — Accessible Reporting Demo

An accessible, low-cognitive-load reporting flow for flagging potential AI training data compliance risks.

This project is a **static GitHub Pages demo** that emphasizes UX clarity, accessibility, and product thinking over backend complexity.

## ✨ What This Is

This demo shows how AI teams can enable **early, low-friction reporting** of potential training data risks — even when users are unsure or lack legal expertise.

It is intentionally designed for:
- Non-experts
- High-uncertainty environments
- Internal tooling contexts

The goal is not enforcement — it’s **visibility, signal, and accountability**.

---

## 🧭 The User Flow

**Step 1: Identify the Concern**
- Users choose from clearly worded issue types
- Each option is presented as a large, selectable card
- No legal language or forced certainty

**Step 2: Add Context (Optional)**
- Users can provide additional detail without pressure
- Reinforces that reporting ≠ blocking deployment

**Completion**
- The flow confirms submission and reinforces trust
- No punitive or alarming messaging

This mirrors how real compliance concerns arise: gradually, ambiguously, and often without full information.

## ♿ Accessibility & UX Principles

This demo intentionally applies:

- **Low cognitive load**
  - One decision per screen
  - Plain-language choices
- **Accessible interaction**
  - Full-card click targets
  - Keyboard- and screen-reader-friendly structure
- **Visual hierarchy**
  - Centered card layout
  - Clear progress indicator
- **Psychological safety**
  - “Not sure” is a first-class option
  - Reporting does not imply wrongdoing

---

## 🎯 Why Static HTML?

This demo uses only HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript to keep the focus on:

- Interaction design
- Accessibility
- Decision clarity

There is no backend, storage, or enforcement logic by design.

In a real system, submissions could route to:
- Compliance review queues
- Audit logs
- Model governance workflows

---

## 🚧 What This Is Not

- Not a full compliance system
- Not legal advice
- Not automated enforcement

This is a **product and UX prototype** demonstrating how better design can reduce risk earlier in the AI lifecycle.

## 🧠 Who This Is For

- AI platform teams
- Responsible AI / governance leads
- Product managers designing internal tools
- UX designers working on compliance or safety flows
