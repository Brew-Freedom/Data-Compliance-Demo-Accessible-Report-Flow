AI Training Data Compliance – Accessible Reporting Demo

An accessible, low-cognitive-load reporting flow for flagging potential AI training data compliance risks — built as a static GitHub Pages demo to emphasize UX clarity, accessibility, and product thinking over tooling complexity.

✨ What This Is

This project demonstrates how AI teams can:

Flag potential data compliance risks early

Lower the barrier for reporting uncertainty

Avoid false certainty while still enabling oversight

Design compliance tools that are usable by non-experts

The demo intentionally focuses on decision clarity and accessibility, not backend enforcement or automation.

🎯 Why Static HTML?

This demo is built with plain HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools.

Why this matters:

Works instantly on GitHub Pages

Zero setup required to review

Keeps focus on UX, accessibility, and flow

Mirrors real-world internal tooling constraints

This is a product and UX demonstration — not a production compliance system.

🧭 Demo Flow

User selects the type of data concern:

Licensing uncertainty

Sensitive or personal data

Unverified sources

Restricted or copyrighted material

“Not sure” (intentional ambiguity support)

User optionally adds context

Report is submitted without blocking deployment

Risk is surfaced for later review

This reflects real compliance workflows, where flagging ≠ automatic rejection.

♿ Accessibility Principles

The demo prioritizes:

Keyboard navigation

Large tap targets

Plain language

Minimal choices per screen

Clear system feedback

Low visual and cognitive load

Designed for:

Engineers

Legal reviewers

Analysts

Non-technical contributors

🧠 Product Thinking Highlight

Key design decisions:

“Not sure” is a valid option → reduces underreporting

No scary warnings → encourages honest reporting

Optional context → avoids forcing narrative

Clear reassurance → reporting doesn’t halt progress
